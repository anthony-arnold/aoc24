Advent of Code Solutions (2024)
===============================

The challenge for this year is to evaluate answers at compile time.

**PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY OF THE CODE IN THIS REPO AS AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD CODE**

Notes
-----

 - The header files contain the inputs - usually in `string_view` form but sometimes preprocessed to take a load of the compiler.
 - Each day's input is declared as `aoc::dayxx_v` where `xx` is the day number.
 - The headers themselves are not included as per the Advent of Code FAQ.
